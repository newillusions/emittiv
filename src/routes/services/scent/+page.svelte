		<h2>the hidden layer</h2>
		<p>scent shapes our emotional response before we even register it. it lingers in memory long after someone has stepped outside. yet it's often left out of spatial design — a missed opportunity.</p>

		<h2>scent as narrative</h2>
		<p>we don't treat scent as a single signature note. we use it to build a narrative. different zones, different times, different moods.</p>
		<p>modern diffusion systems can cycle through multiple fragrances, shifting on schedule or by activity: bright in the morning, grounding in the evening, distinct tones for different areas. scent becomes part of the choreography.</p>

		<h2>designing with scent</h2>
		<p>we collaborate with fragrance houses and system manufacturers. our role is defining where scent is used, how it's delivered, and guiding clients toward the right fragrance direction.</p>
		<p>delivery options include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>HVAC-integrated diffusion</strong> for broad coverage</li>
			<li><strong>standalone units</strong> for specific zones</li>
			<li><strong>programmable systems</strong> that adjust intensity or fragrance by schedule or occupancy</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>part of the whole</h2>
		<p>scent works best when aligned with lighting, sound and movement. warm light with warm fragrances. energising audio with bright, fresh tones. coordinated layers reinforce each other.</p>
		<p>we design scent as part of the complete sensory experience — not an add-on.</p>

		<h2>seeing it through</h2>
		<p>our involvement runs from concept to installation. specifying systems, coordinating suppliers, supervising on site. final adjustments — diffusion rates, timing, zone balance — are where the detail matters.</p>

		<h2>no supplier lock-in</h2>
		<p>we're independent. we don't sell fragrance or hardware, and we don't lock clients into a specific partner. we recommend based on coverage, maintenance, budget and performance. the fragrance relationship ultimately belongs to the client.</p>
