				<p>
					This privacy policy explains how emittiv L.L.C-FZ ("emittiv", "we", "us") handles
					information when you visit emittiv.com. We keep it straightforward because our website
					is straightforward.
				</p>
				<p>
					emittiv may update this policy from time to time. Changes take effect when published
					on this page.
				</p>

				<span class="section-head">What we collect</span>
				<p>
					We collect very little. This website has no user accounts, no login system, and no
					comment functionality.
				</p>
				<p>The only personal information we collect is what you voluntarily provide through our
					<strong>contact form</strong>: your name, email address, and message. This information
					is sent to us via EmailJS, a third-party email delivery service, and arrives as a
					standard email. We do not store contact form submissions in a database.
				</p>

				<span class="section-head">Analytics</span>
				<p>
					We use <strong>Matomo</strong>, a privacy-focused analytics platform, hosted on our
					own infrastructure. Our Matomo configuration is set to <strong>cookieless
					tracking</strong> — no cookies are placed on your device for analytics purposes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Matomo collects anonymised usage data such as pages visited, approximate geographic
					region, device type, and referral source. This data cannot be used to identify you
					personally. Your IP address is anonymised before being processed.
				</p>
				<p>
					We use this data solely to understand how our website is used and to improve it.
				</p>

				<span class="section-head">Cookies</span>
				<p>
					This website does not set any cookies for analytics, tracking, or advertising. No
					cookie consent banner is required because there are no cookies to consent to.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your browser may store standard technical data (such as cached files) as part of
					normal web browsing. This is controlled by your browser settings, not by us.
				</p>

				<span class="section-head">Third-party services</span>
				<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>EmailJS</strong> — processes contact form submissions. Their privacy policy
						is available at emailjs.com.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Cloudflare</strong> — hosts and delivers this website. Cloudflare may
						collect standard web server logs (IP address, browser type, pages requested) as
						part of their content delivery service.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We do not use any advertising networks, social media tracking pixels, or third-party
					analytics services beyond our self-hosted Matomo instance.
				</p>

				<span class="section-head">Links to other websites</span>
				<p>
					Our website contains links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy
					practices of other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of any
					linked sites you visit.
				</p>

				<span class="section-head">Data security</span>
				<p>
					This website is served over HTTPS. Contact form submissions are transmitted securely
					via EmailJS. We do not operate a database connected to this website and do not store
					visitor data beyond our anonymised analytics.
				</p>

				<span class="section-head">Your rights</span>
				<p>
					Since we collect minimal personal data and do not maintain user accounts, there is
					very little data we could hold about you. If you have contacted us via the contact
					form and wish to have your correspondence deleted, please email us at
					privacy (at) emittiv.com.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the UAE Federal Decree-Law No. 45 of 2021 on the Protection of Personal Data
					and applicable international data protection regulations, you have the right to
					request access to, correction of, or deletion of any personal data we hold.
				</p>

				<span class="section-head">Contact</span>
				<p>
					For any privacy-related enquiries, contact us at privacy (at) emittiv.com or use
					our <a class="navItem" href="/contact">contact form</a>.
