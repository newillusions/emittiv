## Main Content

### one system, unified control

individual sensory systems — lighting, video, sound, scent — are powerful on their own. but the real impact comes when they work together in harmony, not as separate layers bolted on top of each other.

this is where our theatrical background really shows. show control is about orchestrating many systems as one — precise timing, smooth transitions, everything responding to the same cues. we bring that discipline to architectural environments.

both founders are recognised experts in control systems across the region — it's a core strength of the practice, and a significant step beyond what most designers deliver.

### scenes and transitions

rather than controlling individual fixtures and devices, we design around **scenes** — predefined combinations of settings that create specific moods and atmospheres.

- **morning arrival** — energising light, upbeat music, fresh scent
- **evening service** — warm lighting, ambient soundscape, richer fragrance
- **event mode** — dramatic lighting, video content, elevated audio

transitions between scenes can be instant or gradual — a slow shift as the day progresses, or a dramatic change for a special moment.

### intuitive interfaces

complex systems should be simple to operate. we design control interfaces that:

- **make sense to non-technical users**
- **provide the right level of control** — simple day-to-day, detailed when needed
- **work across devices** — wall panels, tablets, phones

### integration and automation

our control systems integrate with building management systems (BMS), booking systems, and other operational platforms. scenes can be triggered automatically by:

- **time schedules**
- **occupancy sensors**
- **calendar events**
- **external systems and APIs**

### beyond presets — responsive environments

we're increasingly interested in generative control — systems that don't just recall preset scenes but actively respond to what's happening. sensor inputs, occupancy patterns, time of day, even weather — all feeding into a system that adjusts in real time.

it's a shift from static programming to living environments. not every project needs this, but where it fits, the results are compelling. we stay close to new tools and platforms in this space, because it's where control design is heading.

### independent by design

we're not tied to any manufacturer or platform. we specify control systems based on what's right for the project — not what we happen to sell or represent. in a market where brand-aligned consultants are common, that independence matters.

we have preferred products that consistently meet our standards, but we'll always recommend what fits the project best.

### built to last

we favour modular systems where components can be swapped rather than whole units replaced. there's a cost difference upfront, but it pays back over the life of an installation — easier maintenance, simpler spares, less e-waste. good for operating budgets, good for the planet.

### on site when it matters

we develop the control strategy, specify hardware and software, and supervise programming and commissioning. the moment when all the systems connect and scenes are programmed for the first time — that's where it all comes together, and we're there for it.
