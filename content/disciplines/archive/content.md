## Main Content

### systems need content

the best video wall is only as good as what it displays. the most sophisticated audio system needs great content to play.

we don't try to do everything in-house. different projects need different styles — some call for a punk rock drummer, others for a classical violinist. rarely the same person. and you probably don't want them both on stage at the same time.

so rather than offering "our guy" for every job, we connect clients with specialists who actually fit. we've built relationships with some of the best content artists in the world, across a range of styles and disciplines.

### content strategy

before creating content, we help define:

- **what stories to tell** — brand narratives, seasonal themes, event tie-ins
- **content types** — ambient loops, featured moments, interactive elements
- **update cadence** — how often content should refresh
- **content guidelines** — ensuring consistency across different creators

### video and generative content

we don't produce video or generative content ourselves — but we know who does. from ambient motion graphics to interactive installations, we connect clients with artists whose work fits the project.

clients can work through us or go direct to the artists. we're not trying to clip the ticket — we just want to see the systems used well.

### audio content

soundscapes and ambient audio we can help with more directly. we develop bespoke audio content that:

- reinforces the atmosphere and story of a space
- varies by zone and time of day
- evolves with seasons and events

### the bridge

when we bring artists into a project, we're happy to stay involved — translating between the technical requirements of the system and the creative ambitions of the content team. we want both sides to understand what's possible and what's practical.

we designed the system. we want to see it sing.
