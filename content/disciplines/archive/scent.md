## Main Content

### the hidden layer

of all our senses, smell has the strongest connection to memory and emotion. it shapes how we feel in a space before we're even conscious of it — and those impressions stay with us long after we leave.

yet scent is rarely considered in spatial design. it's a hugely underutilised tool, and one of the most powerful ways to influence how people experience an environment.

### scent as narrative

we don't think of scent as a single signature fragrance. we use it to tell a story — shifting as people move through a space, changing through the day, reinforcing the journey.

modern diffusion systems can hold multiple scents, switching between them on schedule or by zone. fresh and bright in the morning. warm and grounding in the evening. different moods for different areas. scent becomes part of the choreography of an experience.

### designing with scent

we work with specialist fragrance suppliers and system manufacturers — our role is designing where scent happens, how it's delivered, and working with clients to select or develop the right fragrances for their spaces.

delivery options include:
- **HVAC-integrated diffusion** for broad coverage across large areas
- **standalone units** for specific zones or moments
- **programmable systems** that shift intensity and fragrance by time or occupancy

### part of the whole

scent works best when coordinated with other sensory layers. warm lighting with warm fragrances. energising music with fresh, bright scents. the elements reinforce each other.

we design scent as part of the complete sensory picture — integrated with lighting, sound and the wider experience, not added as an afterthought.

### seeing it through

we stay with the project from early concept through installation — system specification, supplier coordination, site supervision. fine-tuning diffusion levels and timing once systems are running is where the details matter most.

### no supplier lock-in

we're not exclusive to any fragrance house or hardware supplier. we recommend systems based on what fits the space and the client's needs — coverage requirements, maintenance preferences, budget. the same goes for fragrances: we help clients find the right scent partners, but those relationships belong to them.
