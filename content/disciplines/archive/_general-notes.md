## Business Model Clarifications

### We Work on the Client's Design Team

emittiv is a **design and consulting** firm. We work on the client's design team, not as contractors.

- We create the vision and documentation
- We supervise contractors during programming and commissioning
- Being there in person during commissioning is critical — ensures design intent is realised

**Preferred phrasing:**
- "we work on the client's design team"
- "we design..." not "we install..."
- "programming supervision" not "programming briefs"
- "working alongside contractors"

**Avoid:**
- Negative framing like "we don't do X" or "we're not contractors"
- Anything that sounds like we're distancing from the project

## Tone & Style

- Lowercase headlines
- Short, punchy sentences
- "we" voice — conversational, not corporate
- Theatrical/experiential language
- Emphasise the entertainment background as differentiator
- Avoid jargon where possible
