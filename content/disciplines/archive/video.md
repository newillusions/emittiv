### beyond the screen

video is no longer confined to displays. it's becoming part of the built environment itself — integrated into facades, ceilings, floors and architectural features.

we design video systems that transform static surfaces into dynamic canvases.

### media facades and architectural video

modern LED technology allows video to be embedded into building skins at scales that were impossible a decade ago. transparent LED, mesh screens, and custom pixel layouts open up new possibilities for architectural expression.

we design:

- **media facades** that animate building exteriors
- **LED video walls** for lobbies, retail and entertainment venues
- **projection mapping** for architectural features and events
- **digital art installations** that respond to context and interaction

### open systems, no lock-in

too often, video installations come with strings attached. proprietary tools, vendor dependencies, content workflows that only work with one provider. when the relationship ends, the client is stuck.

we take a different approach. we design systems and workflows that are open — any content developer the client chooses to work with, now or in the future, can create for and update the system. the client owns their platform, not just their content.

our systems are designed to be:

- **open** — standard formats, documented workflows, no proprietary traps
- **easily updated** by whoever the client works with
- **scheduled and automated** for different times and events
- **integrated** with lighting, sound and control systems

### technical and creative

we bridge the gap between creative vision and technical reality. we can provide initial concepts and ideas for what a system might do — then it's up to the client's creative teams and their content partners to take it further.

we work on the client's design team through system specification and installation supervision. we also connect clients with content developers from our network when needed — but the client is never locked into working with anyone, including us.

### the full arc

we're involved from early feasibility through to installation — concept development, detailed design, procurement support, supervision. calibrating systems and loading content on site is where theory meets reality.

using the latest 3d visualisation software, we can model viewing angles, pixel densities and content legibility before anything is built — helping clients and their teams understand what they're getting before committing.

### brand neutral

we don't sell LED panels or media servers. we specify what the project needs — evaluating products on merit, not margin. in a market where many consultants are tied to specific manufacturers, that independence protects the client's interests.

we favour products designed for longevity — modular LED panels where tiles and power supplies can be swapped, processors that support firmware updates rather than forced replacement. the upfront cost is sometimes higher, but the total cost of ownership is lower.
