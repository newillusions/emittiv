### more than just light levels

lighting sets the mood. it guides attention, creates atmosphere, and shapes how people feel in a space.

we bring theatrical lighting expertise to the built environment — the same techniques used to tell stories on stage, applied to the spaces where people live, work and play.

### dynamic lighting design

static lighting is a missed opportunity. our designs are **programmable and responsive** — shifting through the day, adapting to events, responding to how spaces are actually used.

- **colour temperature shifts** that follow natural daylight rhythms
- **layered scenes** for different times and uses
- **texture and pattern** — dappled light, soft shadows, the interplay you find in nature
- **integration with video and control systems** for coordinated effects

### theatrical techniques, architectural applications

our background in live entertainment means we understand light as a creative medium, not just a technical requirement.

we design lighting that:
- creates **focal points and visual hierarchy**
- uses **colour as an emotional tool** — subtle washes, shifts in tone
- supports **wayfinding and spatial definition**
- enhances **architectural features and materials**
- delivers **emotional impact and memorable experiences**

### from concept to commissioning

we work across the full project lifecycle — from early concept development through detailed design, procurement support, and installation supervision.

**we work on the client's design team** — creating the vision and documentation, then working alongside contractors to ensure it's realised correctly. supervising programming and commissioning is a critical part of what we do — being there in person to make sure the final result matches the design intent.

our deliverables include lighting layouts, fixture specifications, control system design, and programming supervision. we use advanced 3d calculation tools to model light levels and coverage — so clients can see how spaces will feel before fixtures are installed.

### no brand allegiances

we don't represent or resell lighting manufacturers. we specify what's right for the project — whether that's a premium European fixture or a cost-effective alternative that does the job just as well. that independence means our recommendations are genuinely in the client's interest.

where possible, we specify modular fixtures — products where drivers and LED modules can be replaced without discarding the entire fitting. a bit more upfront, but it extends the life of an installation and keeps maintenance simple.
