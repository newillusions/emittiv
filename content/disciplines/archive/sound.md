## Main Content

### shaping spaces with sound

sound is often overlooked in architectural design. yet it profoundly affects how we experience spaces — from the energy of a retail environment to the calm of a spa.

we approach sound holistically. the playback system, the content, the room acoustics, even how people move through and occupy a space — these aren't separate problems. they're one system, and we design them together.

### beyond background music

sound design is more than choosing a playlist. it's about:
- **spatial audio** that places sound in three dimensions, not just left and right
- **environmental sources** — sound that emerges from the space itself, not obviously from speakers
- **content that fits** — curated or composed to reinforce the experience
- **zoning and control** that allows different areas to have different characters

### networked audio systems

modern networked audio (Dante, AES67) provides unprecedented flexibility. audio can be routed anywhere, zones can be reconfigured in software, and systems can scale as spaces evolve.

we design systems that are:
- **flexible** — easily adapted as needs change
- **integrated** — working with lighting and video for coordinated scenes
- **manageable** — with intuitive control interfaces

### soundscapes and ambient audio

beyond speech and music, ambient soundscapes can subtly reinforce the character of a space. the sound of water and birdsong in a wellness centre. the energy of a market in a food hall. sounds that feel like they belong.

we develop bespoke audio content — or work with specialist composers — to create soundscapes that support the experience. when we collaborate with composers, we bring them into the system design early. understanding where the sound sources are and what the system can do shapes what they create. it shows in the final result.

### through to handover

we join the client's design team early — developing the audio strategy, specifying systems, and staying involved through installation. tuning and balancing on site is where the system comes to life.

with acoustic modelling software, we can predict coverage patterns and sound levels across a space during design — catching problems on screen rather than on site.

### manufacturer independent

we're not aligned with any audio brand. we specify systems based on the project requirements — not because we have a distribution deal or sales target to meet. there are manufacturers we trust and return to often, but the choice is always driven by what fits.

we also lean towards equipment that's repairable and modular where practical. amplifiers with replaceable cards, speakers with serviceable components. the premium is worth it — installations last longer and generate less waste.
