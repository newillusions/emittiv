## Main Content

### shaping spaces with sound

sound has a profound impact on how a space feels, yet it's often handled last. the playback system, the acoustics, the content, how people move — it's all connected. we treat it as one system.

### beyond background music

sound design isn't just setting a playlist. it's about:

- **spatial audio** that places sound in three dimensions
- **environmental sources** that feel native to the space
- **purposeful content** — curated or composed for the environment
- **zoning and control** that gives each area its own character

### networked audio systems

Dante, AES67 and modern networked platforms allow routing and reconfiguration with ease. zones shift in software. systems scale without redesign.

we design audio that is:

- **flexible** — ready for change
- **integrated** — part of the wider sensory system
- **manageable** — intuitive to operate

### soundscapes and ambient audio

ambient soundscapes can define atmosphere subtly but powerfully: water and birdsong in wellness, the energy of a market in a food hall, quiet tonal layers in a lobby.

we create bespoke audio content or collaborate with composers. when we bring composers in, it's early — understanding the system and the space shapes their work, and it shows in the end result.

### through to handover

we join early in the design process, specify hardware and strategy, and stay involved through installation. tuning on site is where the system takes shape.

acoustic modelling tools allow us to predict coverage and identify issues long before speakers are hung.

### manufacturer independent

we don't sell equipment. we specify what the project needs. we have manufacturers we trust, but the choice always follows the brief.

we also lean toward repairable, modular equipment — amplifiers with swappable cards, serviceable loudspeakers. the lifespan is longer, and long-term waste is lower.
