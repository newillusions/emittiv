### more than just light levels

lighting shapes atmosphere, guides focus and affects how people feel — often more than they realise.

our roots in theatre mean we treat light as a narrative tool, not just a technical requirement. the same principles that shape a stage can transform a lobby, a restaurant or a public space.

### dynamic lighting design

spaces change through the day. lighting should too. our systems are **programmable and responsive**:

- **colour-temperature shifts** that mirror natural daylight
- **layered scenes** for different uses and times
- **texture and pattern** — soft shadows, dappled light, the kind of detail you find outdoors
- **integration with video and control systems** for coordinated effects

### theatrical techniques, architectural applications

from entertainment we bring an understanding of timing, contrast, rhythm and emotional impact.

we design lighting that:
- creates **focal points and hierarchy**
- uses **colour as an emotional tool**
- supports **wayfinding and spatial clarity**
- enhances **materials and architectural features**
- delivers **memorable experiences**

### from concept to commissioning

we stay involved through the full arc of a project — early concept, detailed design, procurement support, installation supervision, programming and commissioning.

**we work as part of the client's design team**, ensuring the outcome matches the intent, not just the drawings. we use advanced 3d calculation tools to model levels and coverage so clients can understand the result before fixtures arrive on site.

our documentation covers layouts, specifications, control strategy and programming requirements — complete and build-ready.

### no brand allegiances

we don't represent manufacturers. we specify what fits the project. sometimes that's a high-end European fixture; other times a carefully chosen alternative.

we often recommend modular fittings with replaceable drivers and LED modules. they cost more upfront but extend system life significantly and keep maintenance straightforward.
