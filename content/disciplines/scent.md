## Main Content

### the hidden layer

scent shapes our emotional response before we even register it. it lingers in memory long after someone has stepped outside. yet it's often left out of spatial design — a missed opportunity.

### scent as narrative

we don't treat scent as a single signature note. we use it to build a narrative. different zones, different times, different moods.

modern diffusion systems can cycle through multiple fragrances, shifting on schedule or by activity: bright in the morning, grounding in the evening, distinct tones for different areas. scent becomes part of the choreography.

### designing with scent

we collaborate with fragrance houses and system manufacturers. our role is defining where scent is used, how it's delivered, and guiding clients toward the right fragrance direction.

delivery options include:
- **HVAC-integrated diffusion** for broad coverage
- **standalone units** for specific zones
- **programmable systems** that adjust intensity or fragrance by schedule or occupancy

### part of the whole

scent works best when aligned with lighting, sound and movement. warm light with warm fragrances. energising audio with bright, fresh tones. coordinated layers reinforce each other.

we design scent as part of the complete sensory experience — not an add-on.

### seeing it through

our involvement runs from concept to installation. specifying systems, coordinating suppliers, supervising on site. final adjustments — diffusion rates, timing, zone balance — are where the detail matters.

### no supplier lock-in

we're independent. we don't sell fragrance or hardware, and we don't lock clients into a specific partner. we recommend based on coverage, maintenance, budget and performance. the fragrance relationship ultimately belongs to the client.
