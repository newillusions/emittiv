### beyond the screen

video is no longer confined to displays. it's now part of architecture — facades, ceilings, floors, structural elements. surfaces become canvases.

### media facades and architectural video

LED technologies have expanded rapidly: transparent panels, mesh systems, custom pixel layouts. building skins can now carry motion and light at an architectural scale.

we design:

- **media facades** that animate exteriors
- **LED video walls** for lobbies, retail and entertainment
- **projection mapping** for features and events
- **digital art installations** that respond to context or interaction

### open systems, no lock-in

many video installations hide long-term dependencies — proprietary tools, closed formats, workflows tied to a single vendor. when that relationship ends, the system stagnates.

we design open platforms. documented workflows. standard formats. any content partner can develop for the system, now or years from now. the client owns the platform, not just the files it plays.

our systems are:

- **open** — no proprietary traps
- **easy to update** — by any creator
- **schedule-friendly** — automated for times and events
- **integrated** — aligned with lighting, sound and control

### technical and creative

we help shape the initial creative direction, then support the client's own teams and partners as the concept evolves. we stay on the design team through specification, installation and commissioning.

we can also introduce content developers where needed — but the client is never locked into a particular studio or workflow.

### the full arc

we're involved from feasibility through build. concept development, detailed design, procurement support, supervision. calibration and content loading on site is where everything becomes real.

3d visualisation tools allow us to map viewing angles, pixel densities and legibility long before construction — avoiding surprises later.

### brand neutral

we don't sell LED or media servers. we evaluate products based on performance and longevity, not incentives. modular LED panels, serviceable components, processors that evolve with firmware — these choices reduce long-term cost and keep systems relevant.
